## 🚀 Usage
To run the Python code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```
2. Navigate to the notebooks directory:
   ```
   cd notebooks
   ```
3. Open `Assignment1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE. Make sure the working directory is set correctly:
   ```python
   import os
   os.chdir("path/to/repository")
   ```
4. Install the required packages as specified at the top of the notebook.

5. Run the cells to reproduce the analyses and results! 🎉

## 📋 Assignment Overview
The assignment required us to:

- Apply machine learning to predict breast cancer mortality and survival rates. 💉
- Use data mining techniques to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data.
- Develop predictive models using Python, following CRISP-DM methodology.
- Evaluate the models' performances and provide critical insights.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
Through this assignment, I was able to:

- **Understand Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques**: Learn how to apply ML algorithms for real-world healthcare challenges.
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Use Python to manipulate and analyze data effectively.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Implement various machine learning models and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Good Programming Practices**: Write modular, clean, and well-documented code. ✨
- **Communicate Results**: Document the entire process effectively in a structured report.

## 📝 Notes
- The `.gitignore` file ensures that unnecessary files are not added to the repository.
- The `indesign` directory contains InDesign files used to compile the final report (optional for running the code).
- A duplicate of the final report PDF is provided in the root directory for easy access.
- All datasets are included in the `data/raw` directory; no external data sources are required.
